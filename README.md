# Drum Machine

This project was developped with the help of [Front End Libraries Free Code Camp's course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `audio files`

The audio is not working on the gh-pages.\
But it is working on local if you download the project. Here is the [online demo](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/MJyNMd) for more information.
